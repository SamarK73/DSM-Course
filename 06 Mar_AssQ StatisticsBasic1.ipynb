Whether you are a data scientist, marketer, businessman, data analyst, researcher, or you are in any other profession, you need to play or experiment with raw or structured data. While working on these data, it is important to know the types of data to process them and get the right results. There are two types of data: Qualitative and Quantitative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#1).Qualitative Data: This type of data cant be measured or counted in the form of numbers. These type of data are sorted by category, not by number. That is why it is also known as categorical data. These data consist of audio, images, symbols, or text. The gender of a person, i.e., male, female, or others, is qualitative data.\n",
    "Qualitative data tells about the perception of people. This data helps market researchers understand the customers’ tastes and then design their ideas and strategies accordingly. \n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "           1. What language do you speak\n",
    "           2. Favorite holiday destination\n",
    "           3. opinion on something\n",
    "           4. Colors\n",
    "  Qualitative data classified into two parts:\n",

    "      #a). Nominal Data: Nominal Data is used to label variables without any order or quantitative value. The color of hair can            be considered nominal data, as one color can’t be compared with another color.  With the help of nominal data, we              can’t do any numerical tasks or can’t give any order to sort the data. These data don’t have any meaningful order;              their values are distributed into distinct categories.\n",

    "      #b). Ordinal Data: Ordinal data have natural ordering where a number is present in some kind of order by their position              on the scale. These data are used for observation like customer satisfaction, happiness, etc., but we can’t do any              arithmetical tasks on them. \n",
    "           Ordinal data is qualitative data for which their values have some kind of relative position. These kinds of data can            be considered “in-between” qualitative and quantitative data. The ordinal data only shows the sequences and cannot              use for statistical analysis. Compared to nominal data, ordinal data have some kind of order that is not present in            nominal data.   \n",

It answers the questions like “how much,” “how many,” and “how often.” For example, the price of a phone, the computer’s ram, the height or weight of a person, etc., falls under quantitative data. \n",
    "Quantitative data can be used for statistical manipulation. These data can be represented on a wide variety of graphs and charts, such as bar graphs, histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, pie charts, line graphs, etc.\n",

The continuous variable can take any value within a range. \n",

    "Levels of measurement:\n",
    "    When carrying out any kind of data collection or analysis, it’s essential to understand the nature of the data you’re           dealing with. Within your dataset, you’ll have different variables—and these variables can be recorded to varying degrees       of precision. This is what’s known as the level of measurement.\n",
    "    There are four main levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1). Nominal Scale :\n",
    "      Nominal scale simply categorizes variables according to qualitative lables(or names). These labels and groupings don't         have any order or hierarchy to them nor do they convey any numerical value. \n",
    "      \n",
    "      For example, the variable “hair color” could be measured on a nominal scale according to the following categories:             blonde hair, brown hair, gray hair, and so on.\n",
    "2). Ordinal Scale:\n",
    "      The ordinal scale also categorizes variables into labeled groups, and these categories have an order or hierarchy to           them.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      For example, you could measure the variable “income” on an ordinal scale as follows: low income, medium income, high           income. Another example could be level of education, classified as follows: high school, master’s degree, doctorate. \n",
    "      \n",
    "3). Iterval Scale:\n",
    "      The interval scale is a numerical scale which labels and orders variables, with a known, evenly spaced interval between         each of the values.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      For example, interval data is temperature in Fahrenheit, where the difference between 10 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit is           exactly the same as the difference between, say, 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.) Ratio Scale:\n",
    "      The ratio scale is exactly the same as the interval scale, with one key difference: The ratio scale has what’s known as a       “true zero.” \n",
    "      A good example of ratio data is weight in kilograms. If something weighs zero kilograms, it truly weighs nothing—compared       to temperature (interval data), where a value of zero degrees doesn’t mean there is “no temperature,” it simply means           it’s extremely cold! "
