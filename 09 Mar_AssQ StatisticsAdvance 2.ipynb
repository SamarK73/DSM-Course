    "    Probability mass function can be defined as the probability that a discrete random variable will be exactly equal to some particular value. In other words, the probability mass function assigns a particular probability to every possible value of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and the sample space is recorded as S = [HH, HT, TH, TT]. The probability of getting heads needs to be determined. Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. X can take on the values 0, 1, 2. The probability that X will be equal to 1 is 0.5. Thus, it can be said that the probability mass function of X evaluated at 1 will be 0.5.\n",

Instead of this, we must calculate the probability of X lying in an interval (a, b). Now, we have to figure it for P(a< X< b), and we can calculate this using the formula of PDF. The Probability density function formula is given as,\n",

This function is positive or non-negative at any point of the graph, and the integral, more specifically the definite integral of PDF over the entire space is always equal to one. The graph of PDFs typically resembles a bell curve, with the probability of the outcomes below the curve.
